# IN PROGRESS
This is currently being worked on, and when it is ready blog.camerongreen.ca will not redirect here

This project is meant to serve a few purposes
1. I want to learn Go 
2. I want a place to write about tech and things I find interesting
3. I want a to put this on my resume

I have a few design goals for this project:
1. No using AI for writing code 
	1. I'm not against it but I believe that if your goal is to learn then it's best to write and solve problems yourself
2. Use markdown for writing posts
	1. I don't want to be writing posts in HTML when converting markdown to HTML is so easy
3. Server side rendering 
	1. I believe that this is the correct choice for a project of this style because the front-end is quite simple, needs minimal JavaScript. This should result in the end user experience being fast and clean
